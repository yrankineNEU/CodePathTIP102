Problem 1: New Horizons
Step 1: Copy the following code into your IDE.

Step 2: Instantiate an instance of the class Villager, which represents characters in Animal Crossing.
Store the instance in a variable named apollo.

The Villager object created should have the name "Apollo", the species "Eagle", 
and the catchphrase "pah".

# Instantiate your villager here
Example Usage:

Example Output:

Apollo
Eagle
pah

Problem 2: Greet Player
Step 1: Using the Villager class from Problem 1, add the following greet_player() 
method to your existing code:

def greet_player(self, player_name):
    return f"{self.name}: Hey there, {player_name}! How's it going, {self.catchphrase}!"
Step 2: Create a second instance of Villager in a variable named bones.

The Villager object created should have name "Bones", species "Dog", and catchphrase "yip yip".
Step 3: Call the method greet_player() with your name and print out
"Bones: Hey there, <your name>! How's it going, yip yip!". 
For example, if your name is Tram, "Bones: Hey there, Tram! How's it going, yip yip?" 
would be printed out to the console.

Example Usage:

print(bones.name)
print(bones.species)  
print(bones.catchphrase) 
print(bones.furniture) 
Example Output:

Bones
Dog
yip y
'''
# Create a second villager named bones
bones = Villager("Bones", "Dog", "dark", "yip yip")

print(bones.greet_player("Yana"))

'''
Problem 3: update catch phrase
'''
bones.catchphrase = "ruff it up"
print(bones.greet_player("Yana"))

'''
Problem 4: Setter methods
Update your Villager class with a method set_catchphrase() 
that takes in one parameter new_catchphrase.

If new_catchphrase is valid, it should update the villager's catchphrase attribute 
to have value new_catchphrase and print "Catchphrase updated".
Otherwise, it should print out "Invalid catchphrase".
Valid catchphrases are less than 20 characters in length. 

They must all contain only alphabetic and whitespace characters.

Example Usage:


Example Output:

Example 1:
Catchphrase Updated!
sweet dreams
Invalid catchphrase
'''
alice = Villager("Alice", "Koala", "cute", "guvnor")

alice.set_catchphrase("sweet dreams")
print(alice.catchphrase)
alice.set_catchphrase("#?!")
print(alice.catchphrase)

'''
Problem 5: Add Furniture

Update the Villager class with a new method add_item() that takes in one parameter, item_name.

The method should validate the item_name.

If the item is valid, add item_name to the players furniture attribute.
The method does not need to return any values.
'''
alice = Villager("Alice", "Koala", "cute", "guvnor")
print(alice.furniture)

alice.add_item("acoustic guitar")
print(alice.furniture)

alice.add_item("cacao tree")
print(alice.furniture)

alice.add_item("nintendo switch")
print(alice.furniture)

'''
Problem 6: Print Inventory

The method should print the name and quantity of each item in a villagerâ€™s furniture list.

The name and quantity should be in the format 
"item1: quantity, item2: quantity, item3: quantity" 
for however many unique items exist in the villager's furniture list
If the player has no items, the function should print "Inventory empty".
'''

alice = Villager("Alice", "Koala", "cute", "guvnor")

alice.print_inventory()

alice.furniture = ["acoustic guitar", "ironwood kitchenette", "kotatsu", "kotatsu"]
print(alice.furniture)
alice.print_inventory()

Problem 7: Personality groups
'''

def of_personality_type(townies, personality_type):

    if townies is None:
        return "No townies is listed."

'''
Problem 8: Telephone
The Villager constructor has been updated to include an additional attribute neighbor. 
A villager's neighbor is another Villager instance and represents their closest neighbor. 
By default, a Villager's neighbor is set to None.

Given two Villager instances start_villager and target_villager, 
write a function message_received() that returns True if you can pass a message 
from the start_villager to the target_villager through a series of neighbors and False otherwise.
'''

    # Print 8 : set neighbor

    # Check the neighbor of each neighbor and if target villager reach, then return true
    while start_villager.neighbor is not None:

Problem 9: LinkedList
Using the provided Node class below, create a linked list Tom Nook -> Tommy where the instance 
tom_nook has value "Tom Nook" which points to the instance tommy that has value "Tommy".

Problem 10: Timmy and Tommy
In a linked list, pointers can be redirected to any place in the list.

Using the linked list from Problem 9, create a new Node timmy with value "Timmy" 
and place it between tom_nook and tommy so the new linked list is tom_nook -> timmy -> tommy.

Problem 12: Print List
Write a function print_list() that takes in the head of a linked list
