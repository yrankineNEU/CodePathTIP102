Problem 1: Building a Playlist
The assignment statement to the top_hits_2010s variable below creates the 
linked list Uptown Funk -> Party Rock Anthem -> Bad Romance. 

Break apart the assignment statement into multiple lines with one call 
to the Node constructor per line to recreate the list.

Problem 2: Top Artists
Given the head of a linked list playlist, 
return a dictionary that maps each artist in the list to its frequency.

Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. 
Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you 
believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

Problem 4: On Repeat
A variation of the two-pointer technique introduced in previous units is 
to have a slow and a fast pointer that increment at different rates.

We would like to check whether our playlist loops or not. Given the head of a linked list playlist_head, 
return True if the playlist has a cycle in it and False otherwise. 
A linked list has a cycle if at some point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer 
points back to a previous node in the list.

has the stated time and space complexity.

Problem 5: Looped
Given the head of a linked list playlist_head that may contain a cycle, 
use the fast and slow pointer method to return the length of the cycle. 
If the list does not contain a cycle, return 0.
