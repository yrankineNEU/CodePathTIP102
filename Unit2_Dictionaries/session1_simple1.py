Problem 1: Festival Lineup
Given two lists of strings artists and set_times of length n, write 
a function lineup() that maps each artist to their set time.

An artist artists[i] has set time set_times[i]. 
Assume i <= 0 < n and len(artists) == len(set_times).


Example Usage:

artists1 = ["Kendrick Lamar", "Chappell Roan", "Mitski", "Rosalia"]
set_times1 = ["9:30 PM", "5:00 PM", "2:00 PM", "7:30 PM"]

artists2 = []
set_times2 = []

print(lineup(artists1, set_times1))
print(lineup(artists2, set_times2))
Example Output:

{"Kendrick Lamar": "9:30 PM", "Chappell Roan": "5:00 PM", "Mitski": "2:00 PM", "RosalÃ­a": "7:30 PM"}
{}
'''
def lineup(artists, set_times):
    # if string is empty return empty dictionary
    if artists is None and set_times is None:
        return {}
    
    # initialize dictionary
    lineup_lst = {}
    
    # Add one at a time and remove from list
    for each in range(len(artists)):
        lineup_lst.update({artists[each] : set_times[each]})
    
    return lineup_lst

artists1 = ["Kendrick Lamar", "Chappell Roan", "Mitski", "Rosalia"]
set_times1 = ["9:30 PM", "5:00 PM", "2:00 PM", "7:30 PM"]

artists2 = []
set_times2 = []

print(lineup(artists1, set_times1))
print(lineup(artists2, set_times2))

Problem 2: Planning App
You are designing an app for your festival to help attendees 
have the best experience possible! As part of the application, 
users will be able to easily search their favorite artist and find out the day, time, 
and stage the artist is playing at. 

Write a function get_artist_info() 
that accepts a string artist and a dictionary festival_schedule mapping artist's 
names to dictionaries containing the day, time, and stage they are playing on. 
Return the dictionary containing the information about the given artist.

If the artist searched for does not exist in festival_schedule, 
return the dictionary {"message": "Artist not found"}.

Example Output:

{'day': 'Friday', 'time': '9:00 PM', 'stage': 'Main Stage'}
{'message': 'Artist not found'}
'''
def get_artist_info(artist, festival_schedule):
    # Initalize message
    message = {'message' : 'Artist not found'}
    
    # Handle if festival schedule is empty
    if festival_schedule is None:
        return message
    
    # Use get key 
    if festival_schedule.get(artist) != None:
        return festival_schedule.get(artist)
    else:
        return message

festival_schedule = {
    "Blood Orange": {"day": "Friday", "time": "9:00 PM", "stage": "Main Stage"},
    "Metallica": {"day": "Saturday", "time": "8:00 PM", "stage": "Main Stage"},
    "Kali Uchis": {"day": "Sunday", "time": "7:00 PM", "stage": "Second Stage"},
    "Lawrence": {"day": "Friday", "time": "6:00 PM", "stage": "Main Stage"}
}

print(get_artist_info("Blood Orange", festival_schedule)) 
print(get_artist_info("Taylor Swift", festival_schedule))  

'''
Problem 3: Ticket Sales
A dictionary ticket_sales is used to map ticket type to number of tickets sold. 
Return the total number of tickets of all types sold.

Example Usage:
'''
def total_sales(ticket_sales):
    pass

ticket_sales = {"Friday": 200, "Saturday": 1000, "Sunday": 800, "3-Day Pass": 2500}
print(total_sales(ticket_sales))
